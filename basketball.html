  <p>Whether I’m playing with friends or just shooting hoops alone, basketball gives me energy and focus. The rhythm of the game, the sound of sneakers squeaking on the court, and the satisfying swish of the ball through the net—it all feels like poetry in motion.<br><br>
    There’s something deeply meditative about it, the movement, the silence between plays. It clears my mind and sharpens my concentration. When I’m out there, nothing else matters. I’m fully present, completely in sync with my body and the game.<br><br>
    Beyond the physical aspect, basketball has taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience. It’s a space where I can challenge myself, push past limits, and feel alive. The court, whether indoor or outdoor, feels like a second home.</p>
