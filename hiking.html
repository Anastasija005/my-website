    <p>Hiking is where I reconnect with everything—nature, my breath, my thoughts. It's one of the rare moments where I feel completely present, surrounded by nothing but sky, trees, and the crunch of gravel beneath my feet. The beauty of a trail isn't just in the destination—it’s in the quiet moments along the way.<br><br>
      Every step feels like a meditation, every view a reward. From sunlit forests to misty mountaintops, hiking fills me with a kind of awe that’s hard to describe. It resets my mind and gives my eyes something real and beautiful to focus on. Screens fade, stress melts, and everything feels simpler.</p>
