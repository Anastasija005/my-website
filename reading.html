  <p>Reading isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s an escape, a teacher, and a companion. A good book can pull me into a new world, introduce me to characters I’ll never forget, or present ideas that linger in my mind long after the last page. I love how stories can stretch time, letting me slow down and sink into a moment.<br><br>
    The act of reading—the turning of pages, the quiet it brings, the focus it demands—has a calming, almost sacred quality to it. I read to dream, to explore, and sometimes just to feel understood. Whether it’s fiction filled with wonder or nonfiction that expands my perspective, books feed both my imagination and my curiosity.
